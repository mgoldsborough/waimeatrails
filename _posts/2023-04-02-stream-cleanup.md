U.S. Army Garrison P≈çhakuloa Training Area (PTA) partnered with the non-profit organization Waimea Trails & Greenways to clear debris from the riverbed at Waimea Trails. Nearly 40 Soldiers from the 84th Engineer Battalion volunteered to support the project after completing their training at PTA.

The one-mile trail is typically maintained by volunteers from the community, but the Soldiers' assistance significantly accelerated the process. Clemson Lam, the director of Waimea Trails & Greenways, expressed gratitude for the Soldiers' help, stating that their work would have taken volunteers around two years to complete.

Lt. Col. Mike Kendall, the commander of the 84th Engineer Battalion, shared that the experience was rewarding, and he plans to bring his family from Oahu to enjoy the trail located in the Waimea Nature Park.

One of the volunteers, Spec. Briana Segeda from the 130th Engineer Brigade based at Schofield Barracks, Oahu, joined to make a positive impact on the community.

The U.S. Army and PTA regularly engage in community service projects, including cleaning up DKI Highway, participating in beach cleanups, and various other initiatives, as part of their commitment to giving back to the community.
